##Next Word Prediction with LSTM and GRU
This project implements a next-word prediction system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models. 
The model is trained on the text of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and can predict the next word based on a given sequence of words. 
It also includes a Streamlit application for user interaction.


##Project Overview
This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a model that can predict the next word in a sequence using two different architectures: LSTM and GRU.
The model is trained on a pre-processed dataset derived from the text of "Hamlet."


##Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
scikit-learn
Streamlit


##Future Improvements
Implement additional model architectures (e.g., Transformer models).
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
Enhance the user interface of the Streamlit app.
Use a larger and more diverse dataset for training.
